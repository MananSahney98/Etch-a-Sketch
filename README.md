This project recreates the experience of an Etch-a-Sketch-style drawing pad in the browser. The grid is dynamically built and user interactions (mouse hover, grid resizing, clearing) allow free-form “sketching”. It’s a fun exercise in DOM manipulation, event handling and responsive UI design.

Features

Create a drawing grid of configurable size.

Draw by moving the mouse over grid cells (hover effect).

Clear the drawing and start over.

(Optional) Easily extendable to support different drawing colors or modes.

Lightweight, clean HTML/CSS/JS with minimal dependencies.
